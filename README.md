## :computer: Technical specification

In this project I'm working with some concepts and patterns such as...

- Self-made containers following [PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) Standard.
- Dependency injection through application.
- Clean architecture.
- Repository pattern.

## :runner: How you can run it?

> First of all, this is a static application, everytime you run it you'll get the same result.


1. Install the dependencies:
```
make install
```

2. Run all the tests to make sure that everything's ok:
```
make test 
```

3. Finally, run the application:
```
make run
```
